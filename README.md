# README FOR COURSERA WEEK 4 GETTING AND CLEANING DATA ASSIGNMENT
## Description of repo
This repo contains the outputs from the assignment. There are four outputs:
* This README - README.md
* Analysis R script - run_analysis.R
* Output table - tidydata.txt
* Codebook - Codebook.md

## Task
The task, using data obtained from accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, was a follows:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## R script
The R-script merges the different data sets, renames the variables and outputs a new table with avergaged values for each variable, activity and subject.

## Output table
The output data is stored in a text file and contains space-separated values.

## Codebook
The codebook details each of the variables in the output table.
